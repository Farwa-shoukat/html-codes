            <div class="title">Chicken</div>
            <p>Chickens are gregarious birds and live together as a flock. Chickens have a communal approach to the incubation of eggs and raising of young. Individual chickens in a flock will dominate others, establishing a ‘pecking order’, with dominant individuals having priority for access to food and nesting locations.</p>

        <section class="menu-item" id="sushi">
            <div class="title">Sushi</div>
            <p>Sushi is a Japanese dish featuring specially prepared rice and usually some type of fish or seafood, often raw, but sometimes cooked. 

                And though you might automatically associate the word sushi with raw fish, it's actually the rice that is the most important ingredient. Indeed, the word "sushi" refers to the sour flavor of the vinegared rice. Regardless of the toppings or fillings, sushi always includes rice.</p>
